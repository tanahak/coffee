## Design & Styling
- Uses existing CSS framework with classes like `.wrappera`, `.img-carda`, `.topa`
- Logo and branding elements integrated
- Navigation includes: Home, Coffee, About (external), Contact, Login
- Footer with copyright and logo
- Form elements may display inline due to existing CSS - use `<br>` tags for proper spacing

## Current Status
- HTML structure complete for main pages
- Navigation links properly set up for internal pages
- Contact form needs JavaScript functionality for:
  - Form submission handling
  - Console logging of form data
  - Thank you message display with template literals
  - Optional form hiding after submission
- JavaScript files linked but need implementation

## Development Notes
- All internal links use relative paths (e.g., `contact.html`)
- External links include `target="_blank"`
- Form validation uses HTML5 required attributes
- JavaScript should use modern ES6+ syntax
- Console logging required for debugging/testing
